# njl2dmn
Hi! I'm NJL, A computer engineering student, aspiring to make my own game, and lastly, a Pythonista. I'm working on lots of personal projects when I'm free.
I take on projects when I find something interesting (ML/AI, GameDev, WebDev, etc.). I'm still working on my portfolio and my skills. Also, I teach what I
learn. If people are interested in what I do (even though limited) I want to teach them.
